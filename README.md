# Deep Learning Publications

The aim of this repository is to create a collaborative structured collection of the main publications on deep learning.  
There should be brief summaries of each of the papers so we could quickly remember the main points of them and attached nice visualizations to ealisy understand them.  

## Index

#### Training Dynamics of Neural Networks

- 1:	Understanding the difficulties of training deep feedforward Neural Networks  
- 2:	Exact Solutions to the Non-Linear Dynamics of Learning in Deep Linear NNs
- 3:	On the Learning Dynamics of Deep Neural Networks

#### Deep Learning Milestones
- 1:	Rectified Linear Units Improve Restricted Boltzmann Machines – ReLU
